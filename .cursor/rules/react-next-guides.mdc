## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state
